Instrumentation
------------------------
The AllSky meteor camera system is comprised of an Ultra-low-light IMX291 camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3b+ unit.
Each of the cameras is fitted with an ultra-low-light fisheye lens with 180-degree field of view.
The camera is powered and connected by a single connector using power-over-ethernet.
These systems have been developed by the 
[Croatian Meteor Network](http://www.co2neteast.rgn.hr/) and 
[Global Meteor Network](https://globalmeteornetwork.org/) 
and all software is open source.

Citizen Science
------------------------


The [NEMETODE Network](http://www.nemetode.org/) is an initiative led by amateur astronomers as a citizen-science project, coordinating meteor-observing activities to detect and analyse as many meteors as possible over the UK and Ireland.
We joined this network with two cameras in late 2016, and our colleague [Michael O'Connell](http://www.astroshot.com/) described our work in [a BAA article from 2017](https://www.britastro.org/journal_item/10332).
Getting started was a team effort, and we really appreciate everyone travelling from all over Ireland and even across the channel to help with the installation.

We have since then hosted regular meetings of the Irish and UK NEMETODE communities since 2017.
Our cameras are pointed so that we have joint coverage with a number of other NEMETODE members in Ireland, and we are working to grow the network and help to fill in some of the geographical coverage gaps.

Education and Research
-------------------------

An annual [Transition Year (TY) Week](https://www.dunsink.dias.ie/education/general-information-for-ty-week/) was set up in February 2017 at Dunsink Observatory to expose students to day-to-day scientific research through the use of meteor data. 
Meteors introduce students to concepts like shockwaves, fluid dynamics, radiative processes, the structure of the atmosphere, the Solar System and orbital dynamics.
Data from the meteor cameras is ideal for TY students because it does not require high-level processing, the concept of meteors is quite simple to grasp, and the mathematics used for triangulation and orbit calculation are accessible to students who have completed the Junior Certificate.
It is very rewarding to see the students applying the Sine Rule and other concepts from Trigonometry to real data (usually for the first time), and realising that they can use Maths to pinpoint the location in Ireland over which a meteor entered the atmosphere.
Students from North and South Dublin and Kildare have participated in our TY Weeks.
We are strongly supported by volunteers during these weeks, including Michael O'Connell, Mike Foylan, David Malone, and DIAS staff and scholars.

In 2018 Mark Molloy from IT Sligo based his 4th Year Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science on developing a machine-learning algorithm to classify images from the Dunsink meteor cameras according to whether they contained a meteor or not.
Many of our images contain clouds, airplanes, birds, bats, satellites, cosmic rays, UFOs, etc., and it is a lot of work to sort through them manually to select only those that contain meteors.
The machine learning algorithm is excellent at excluding images that do not contain a meteor, and makes our lives a lot easier!
We are looking to develop this further and contribute to the many projects all over the world that are searching for meteors.
