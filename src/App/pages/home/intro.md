Introduction and History
-----------------------------

After some years with no active observations taking place at DIAS Dunsink Observatory, we initiated some projects to restart observing activities with citizen science and education projects.
We started meteor observations with the installation of 2 [NEMETODE](http://www.nemetode.org/NEMETODE%20Team/Dunsink%20Observatory.htm) cameras in September 2016.
A radio-based meteor detection system followed in January 2017.
In 2018 a Vantage Pro II weather station was bought for Dunsink Observatory to monitor the weather on the grounds, and it is [recording data every 30 minutes](https://www.dunsink.dias.ie/weather/) since then.
Following the success of the NEMETODE cameras, Dunsink Observatory installed two new cameras to observe meteors in October 2019, with higher-resolution imagery and wider sky coverage.
A "light meter" was also installed at the Observatory at the same time, to measure how dark/bright the night sky is, and how this evolves over time.
April 2020 saw the start of a Royal Society Public Engagement grant to expand the AllSky meteor cameras over 5 more locations in Ireland.
We are currently assembling and testing the systems at Dunsink.
