Introduction and History
-----------------------------

After some years with no active observations taking place at DIAS Dunsink Observatory, we initiated some projects to restart observing activities with citizen science and education projects.
We started meteor observations with the installation of 2 [NEMETODE](http://www.nemetode.org/NEMETODE%20Team/Dunsink%20Observatory.htm) cameras in September 2016.
A radio-based meteor detection system followed in January 2017.
In 2018 a Vantage Pro II weather station was bought for Dunsink Observatory to monitor the weather on the grounds, and it is [recording data every 30 minutes](https://www.dunsink.dias.ie/weather/) since then.
Following the success of the NEMETODE cameras, Dunsink Observatory installed two new cameras to observe meteors in October 2019, with higher-resolution imagery and wider sky coverage.
A "light meter" was also installed at the Observatory at the same time, to measure how dark/bright the night sky is, and how this evolves over time.
April 2020 saw the start of a Royal Society Public Engagement grant to expand the AllSky meteor cameras over 5 more locations in Ireland.
We are currently assembling and testing the systems at Dunsink.

Instrumentation
------------------------
The AllSky meteor camera system is comprised of an Ultra-low-light IMX291 camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3b+ unit.
Each of the cameras is fitted with an ultra-low-light fisheye lens with 180-degree field of view.
The camera is powered and connected by a single connector using power-over-ethernet.
These systems have been developed by the 
[Croatian Meteor Network](http://www.co2neteast.rgn.hr/) and 
[Global Meteor Network](https://globalmeteornetwork.org/) 
and all software is open source.

Citizen Science
------------------------


The [NEMETODE Network](http://www.nemetode.org/) is an initiative led by amateur astronomers as a citizen-science project, coordinating meteor-observing activities to detect and analyse as many meteors as possible over the UK and Ireland.
We joined this network with two cameras in late 2016, and our colleague [Michael O'Connell](http://www.astroshot.com/) described our work in [a BAA article from 2017](https://www.britastro.org/journal_item/10332).
Getting started was a team effort, and we really appreciate everyone travelling from all over Ireland and even across the channel to help with the installation.

We have since then hosted regular meetings of the Irish and UK NEMETODE communities since 2017.
Our cameras are pointed so that we have joint coverage with a number of other NEMETODE members in Ireland, and we are working to grow the network and help to fill in some of the geographical coverage gaps.

Education and Research
-------------------------

An annual [Transition Year (TY) Week](https://www.dunsink.dias.ie/education/general-information-for-ty-week/) was set up in February 2017 at Dunsink Observatory to expose students to day-to-day scientific research through the use of meteor data. 
Meteors introduce students to concepts like shockwaves, fluid dynamics, radiative processes, the structure of the atmosphere, the Solar System and orbital dynamics.
Data from the meteor cameras is ideal for TY students because it does not require high-level processing, the concept of meteors is quite simple to grasp, and the mathematics used for triangulation and orbit calculation are accessible to students who have completed the Junior Certificate.
It is very rewarding to see the students applying the Sine Rule and other concepts from Trigonometry to real data (usually for the first time), and realising that they can use Maths to pinpoint the location in Ireland over which a meteor entered the atmosphere.
Students from North and South Dublin and Kildare have participated in our TY Weeks.
We are strongly supported by volunteers during these weeks, including Michael O'Connell, Mike Foylan, David Malone, and DIAS staff and scholars.

In 2018 Mark Molloy from IT Sligo based his 4th Year Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science on developing a machine-learning algorithm to classify images from the Dunsink meteor cameras according to whether they contained a meteor or not.
Many of our images contain clouds, airplanes, birds, bats, satellites, cosmic rays, UFOs, etc., and it is a lot of work to sort through them manually to select only those that contain meteors.
The machine learning algorithm is excellent at excluding images that do not contain a meteor, and makes our lives a lot easier!
We are looking to develop this further and contribute to the many projects all over the world that are searching for meteors.

We are grateful to our funders for supporting Citizen Science and Education at Dunsink Observatory:

 * The NEMETODE cameras were installed in 2016 thanks to a Science Week grant from [Science Foundation Ireland](https://www.sfi.ie/).
 * In 2020 we received a grant from the Royal Society Public Engagement Fund to build up our online presence and start to build an all-Ireland network of all-sky cameras.
